Installation
Change directory to the directory holding the unzipped APEX software.

$ cd /home/oracle/apex
Connect to SQL*Plus as the SYS user and run the "apexins.sql" script, specifying the relevant tablespace names and image URL.

SQL> CONN sys@pdb1 AS SYSDBA
SQL> -- @apexins.sql tablespace_apex tablespace_files tablespace_temp images
SQL> 
SQL> @apexins.sql APEX APEX TEMP /i/
Once complete, change the admin password by running the "apxchpwd.sql" scripts as the SYS user.

SQL> CONN sys@pdb1 AS SYSDBA
SQL> @apxchpwd.sql
If you want to add the user silently, you could run the following code, specifying the required password and email.

BEGIN
    APEX_UTIL.set_security_group_id( 10 );
    
    APEX_UTIL.create_user(
        p_user_name       => 'ADMIN',
        p_email_address   => 'me@example.com',
        p_web_password    => 'PutPasswordHere',
        p_developer_privs => 'ADMIN' );
        
    APEX_UTIL.set_security_group_id( null );
    COMMIT;
END;
/
Create the APEX_LISTENER and APEX_REST_PUBLIC_USER users by running the "apex_rest_config.sql" script.

SQL> CONN sys@pdb1 AS SYSDBA
SQL> @apex_rest_config.sql
If you want to add these users silently, you can specify the passwords as parameters to the script.

SQL> CONN sys@pdb1 AS SYSDBA
SQL> @apex_rest_config.sql ApexPassword1 ApexPassword2
Embedded PL/SQL Gateway (EPG) Configuration
If you want to use the Embedded PL/SQL Gateway (EPG) to front APEX, you can follow the instructions here. This is used for both the first installation and upgrades.

 With the exception of setting the port to a non-zero value, this step is required for ORDS setup too.

Run the "apex_epg_config.sql" script, passing in the base directory of the installation software as a parameter.

SQL> CONN sys@pdb1 AS SYSDBA
SQL> @apex_epg_config.sql /home/oracle
Unlock the ANONYMOUS account.

SQL> ALTER USER ANONYMOUS ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
Check the port setting for XML DB Protocol Server.

SQL> SELECT DBMS_XDB.gethttpport FROM DUAL;

GETHTTPPORT
-----------
          0

1 row selected.

SQL>
If it is set to "0", you will need to set it to a non-zero value to enable it.

SQL> EXEC DBMS_XDB.sethttpport(8080);

PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.

SQL>
APEX should now be available from a URL like "http://machine:port/apex".

Oracle HTTP Server (OHS) Configuration
If you want to use Oracle HTTP Server (OHS) to front APEX, you can follow the instructions here.

Change the password and unlock the APEX_PUBLIC_USER account. This will be used for any Database Access Descriptors (DADs).

SQL> ALTER USER APEX_PUBLIC_USER IDENTIFIED BY myPassword ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
If you don't want the password to expire you will need to create a new profile with password expiration disabled and assign it to the user.

Create a DAD in the OHS:

Log into EM (http://server:port/em)
From the tree select "Farm_DomainName > Web Tier > ohs1"
On the resulting page select "Oracle HTTP Server > Administration > Advanced Configuration"
From the dropdown list slect "dads.conf" and click the "Go" button.
Edit the "dads.conf" file, adding an entry like that shown below, then click the "Apply" button.
<Location /apex>
   Order deny,allow
   PlsqlDocumentPath docs
   AllowOverride None
   PlsqlDocumentProcedure         wwv_flow_file_mgr.process_download
   PlsqlDatabaseConnectString     pdb1 TNSFormat
   PlsqlNLSLanguage               AMERICAN_AMERICA.AL32UTF8
   PlsqlAuthenticationMode        Basic
   SetHandler                     pls_handler
   PlsqlDocumentTablename         wwv_flow_file_objects$
   PlsqlDatabaseUsername          APEX_PUBLIC_USER
   PlsqlDefaultPage               apex
   PlsqlDatabasePassword          myPassword
   PlsqlRequestValidationFunction wwv_flow_epg_include_modules.authorize
   PlsqlPathAlias                 r
   PlsqlPathAliasProcedure        wwv_flow.resolve_friendly_url
   Allow from all
</Location>
Select the "Oracle HTTP Server > Control > Restart" option.
Click the resulting "Restart" button.
Once restarted, click the "Close" button.
Alternatively, edit the "dads.conf" file directly. For the OHS that comes with Forms and Reports Services, this is located here "$FR_INST/config/OHS/ohs1/mod_plsql/dads.conf". Once amended, remember to restart the HTTP server.

$ $FR_INST/bin/opmnctl restartproc process-type=OHS
Copy the APEX images to your Oracle HTTP Server.

$ cp -R /tmp/apex/images $FR_INST/config/OHS/ohs1/htdocs/apex_images
Make them available from the "/i/" alias by adding the following alias to the virtual host defined in the "ssl.conf" or "httpd.conf" file in the "$FR_INST/config/OHS/ohs1" directory.

Alias /i/ "/u01/app/oracle/middleware/FR_inst/config/OHS/ohs1/htdocs/apex_images/"
APEX should now be available from a URL like "http://machine:port/apex".

Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) Configuration
If you want to use Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) to front APEX, you can follow the instructions here.

Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) 3.0 and 17.x Installation on Tomcat 7, 8 and 9
Network ACLS
If your APEX installation needs to contact other servers on the network, you will need to create the appropriate ACLs to allow account to the network services. This is discussed here.
